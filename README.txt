GREETINGS FROM TEAM-1(MPHT): MONIKA, PRAJWAL, HARDIK & TEJASVI

--------------------------------------------------------------

1. SIMPLE OPEN THE 'HOTEL_MANAGEMENT.EXE' FILE TO ACCESS OUR PROGRAM.

--------------------------------------------------------------

2. THE DEFAULT CREDENTIAL (CASE-SENSITIVE) FOR THE PROGRAM IS:

USERNAME- 'user'
PASSWORD- 'password'

*THE CREDENTIALS CAN BE CHANGED ACCORDING TO YOUR PREFERENCES.

--------------------------------------------------------------

3. ON SUCCESSFULLY LOGGING IN, THE MAIN MENU WILL APPEAR, FROM WHERE THE USER WILL SELECT THE DESIRED OPTION AND IT WILL BE EXECUTED. IT IS A VERY SIMPLE AND INTUITUVE PROGRAM. 
THE MENU OPTIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS:

-1- FOR CREATING A CUSTOMER RECORD (IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY EXIST) AND ALLOTING A UNIQUE CUST. ID TO THEM (CUST. ID IS MANUALLY ALLOTED FOR NOW).
THEN, BOOKING A ROOM FOR THEM (STARTING FROM BOOKING NO-1 FOR THE PARTICULAR CUSTOMER).

-2- FOR DISPLAYING THE CUSTOMERS WITH THEIR BOOKING RECORDS
(CUST. ID, NAME, BOOKING NO, ROOM NO, PERIOD, ARRIVAL DATE).

-3- FOR DELETING A CUSTOMER RECORD FROM THE DATABASE (ALL BOOKINGS MADE UNDER THE CUSTOMER ID ARE ALSO DELETED).

-4- FOR SEARCHING AND DISPLAYING A CUSTOMER RECORD ALONGWITH THEIR BOOKING(S). THERE IS AN OPTION TO EITHER DISPLAY ALL BOOKINGS MADE BY THE CUSTOMER OR A PARTICULAR, AS REQUIRED.
THEN, THE BILL CAN BE PRINTED FOR THE BOOKING (STAY) RECORD BEING SHOWN AT THAT MOMENT (FOR CHECKING OUT). 

-5- FOR EDITING A CUSTOMER (BOOKING) RECORD. THERE IS THE OPTION TO ENTER THE BOOKING NO, THEN THE RECORD FOR ONLY THAT BOOKING WILL BE CHANGED.

--------------------------------------------------------------

4. ROOM NUMBERS ARE SO USED FOR THE PROGRAM THAT THE FIRST DIGIT IS THE FLOOR NUMBER, SECOND DIGIT IS THE OCCUPANCY NUMBER (1 FOR SINGLE, 2 FOR DOUBLE), AND THIRD DIGIT IS THE ROOM NUMBER FOR ROOMS HAVING THE SPECIFIED OCCUPANCY ON THAT FLOOR. 
FLOORS 1-6 HAVE BEEN SET FOR STANDARD ROOMS AND FLOORS 7-10 HAVE BEEN SET FOR DELUXE ROOMS (WITH BOTH OCCUPANCY OPTIONS).
THE RATE FOR STANDARD ROOMS HAS BEEN SET AS ?1000/- (SINGLE OCCUPANCY) & ?2000/- (DOUBLE OCCUPANCY) PER DAY, AND FOR DELUXE ROOMS, AT ?2500/- (SINGLE OCCUPANCY) & ?5000/- (DOUBLE OCCUPANCY) PER DAY. 
THE TAX APPLICABLE ON THIS HAS BEEN SET AT 18% (GST), WHICH IS ALSO INCLUDED IN THE BILL.
THIS ALGORITHM HAS BEEN USED FOR CALCULATING THE BILL IN OUR PROGRAM FOR ANY PARTICULAR BOOKING (ROOM TYPE AND RATE DO NOT HAVE TO BE EXPLICITLY ENTERED EVERYTIME BECAUSE OF THIS, FOR EASY AND HASSLE-FREE CHECKOUTS).

*ALL THIS WILL BE CHANGED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OFFERINGS AND PRICING IN YOUR HOTEL.

--------------------------------------------------------------

4. IF ANY MENU OPTION (DATABASE MODIFICATION FUNCTION) IS RUN WITHOUT FIRST CREATING A DATABASE, THE PROGRAM WILL END.
"BOOK A ROOM" MENU OPTION (OR "ADD" FUNCTION) CREATES THE DATABASE AUTOMATICALLY, WHEN RUN FOR THE FIRST TIME. THEREFORE, FIRST CREATE A CUSTOMER/BOOKING RECORD BEFORE TRYING ANY OTHER FEATURES OF OUR PROGRAM

--------------------------------------------------------------

5. THANKYOU FOR USING OUR PROGRAM!
